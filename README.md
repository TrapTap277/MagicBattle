Magic Battle is a game I developed based on the principles of the horror game Buckshot Roulette, but in a fantasy format.

The mechanics of the game are similar: the player and the opponent take turns attacking each other with spells, while using various abilities. This continues until one of them wins or loses.

Can you save the world from the evil demon Bedlan? The choice is yours.
